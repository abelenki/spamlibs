The front page of the application shows a list of spam emails that have been 
submitted to via spam robots from all over the world.

Clicking on any of the titles of the spam messages displayed will take you to the
:ref:`seeding` page.

This page allows you to replace parts of the original message with your own terms.
This is the part where you get to be creative! Use your imagination, and have fun
coming up with different terms for each of the parts of speech.

When you are done seeding the message, submit the form, and you will be taken to 
the combined message. When you are there, you can view the original message on the
:ref:`viewing` page.

Sometimes, it is just as hilarious to view the spam email that originally was used
in the spamlib.  There are often typos, misused phrases, reversed participles, and
mixed tenses.  I wonder if the spam robots are using spamlibs, too!
