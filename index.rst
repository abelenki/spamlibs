Welcome to Spamlibs
====================

Spamlibs is a web application that takes annoying spam email messages and makes
them fun again! By using natural language processing (`NLP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing>`_),
the language terms in spam emails are analyzed and deconstructed. It's up to you
to put the messages back together by inserting your own terms, often with hilarious
results.

Start by browsing the :doc:`users_guide`, and make yourself comfortable. If you 
would like to start hacking on the code head over to the :doc:`developers_guide`
to see how you can contribute or change the code to your liking.
